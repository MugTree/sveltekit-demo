## Choosing the Right Spot  
Before you begin, it’s crucial to pick the right location. Vegetables need at least six hours of direct sunlight per day. Make sure the soil is well-drained and rich in organic matter. You can also improve the soil by adding compost or mulch.  
## Selecting the Right Vegetables  
As a beginner, it’s best to start with easy-to-grow vegetables like tomatoes, cucumbers, and lettuce. Consider planting in raised beds or containers if your garden space is limited. This can help with drainage and soil control.');

## Environmental Impact

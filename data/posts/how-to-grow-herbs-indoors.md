name: "How to Grow Herbs Indoors"

Growing herbs indoors is a convenient and rewarding way to have fresh ingredients at your fingertips year-round.  \n## Choosing the Right Herbs  \nNot all herbs thrive indoors, so choose varieties like basil, mint, and thyme, which do well in containers and limited space. Ensure you have pots with good drainage and a sunny windowsill. Herbs need plenty of sunlight, so aim for at least six hours a day.  \n## Watering and Care  \nIndoor herbs need regular watering but avoid overwatering. Allow the soil to dry out between waterings. Prune your herbs frequently to encourage growth and prevent them from becoming leggy.

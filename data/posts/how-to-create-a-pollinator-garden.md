name: "How to Create a Pollinator Garden"

Pollinator gardens are essential for attracting bees, butterflies, and other beneficial insects that help with pollination.  \n## Selecting the Right Plants  \nTo create a successful pollinator garden, choose plants that bloom at different times of the year. Native wildflowers, lavender, and sunflowers are excellent choices. These plants provide nectar and pollen, essential food sources for pollinators.  \n## Providing Shelter and Water  \nIn addition to plants, pollinators need shelter and water. Include features like small water dishes and rock piles where insects can rest. Avoid using pesticides in your pollinator garden, as they can harm these beneficial creatures.

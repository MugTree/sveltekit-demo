Composting is a fantastic way to recycle organic waste and enrich your soil, making it a great practice for any gardener.  

## What is Composting?  

Composting involves breaking down organic matter like kitchen scraps, leaves, and yard waste into nutrient-rich soil. This soil can then be used to fertilize your garden, helping plants grow healthier.  

## Environmental Impact  

Composting reduces the amount of waste sent to landfills, which lowers methane emissions. Itâ€™s a simple way to make your gardening more sustainable and eco-friendly. Start by setting up a compost bin and regularly adding organic material. Turn the pile to aerate it and speed up the decomposition process.
